#Sass File Organization

Organize sass files into a structure according to the ITCSS approach.

* Settings: variables
* Tools: mixins and functions
* Generic: Use for Normalize or css reset plus for things like font-smoothing, box-sizing, or other global styles.
* Elements: Base styles for HTML elements. Keep to a minimum.
* Objects: CSS objects, such as media.
* Components: Most of the project's custom styles will go here. Examples: user profile card; sharing widget; footer.
* Utilities: Helper classes or anything that needs to over-ride other styles. Generally keep to a minimum, but useful for things like accessibility-related classes.
